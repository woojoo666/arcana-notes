# Note that some things are either impossible to check in the grammar (due to modular parsing), or just more difficult.
# So we defer some of these checks to post-grammar parsing.

# Checks deferred to post-process:
#	parameters can be declared inside or outside the block, but not both
#	braced blocks and indented blocks have different rules for where the "template" keyword can go
#	nested blocks with special restrictions, eg:
#		for bracket property access, the bracket block actually has to be a one-item list
#		for object destructuring, 
#	private identifiers can't be used in property access, eg `foo._bar`
#   when stripping parenthesis, the block inside must be a single-item list

Block 		-> Params:? (Statement (","|"\n")):* Statement:?		# note: trailing commas allowed

Params		-> VarList ">>"
VarList		-> (%identifier ",":?):* %identifier					# commas optional, but no trailing commas allowed

Statement	-> %identifier ":" Expression							# properties (TODO: support destructuring)
			| "[" %identifier "]" ":" Expression					# dynamic keys (TODO: support destructuring)
			| SpacedItem:+											# one or more space-delimited list items
			| SpacedUnary											# a single spaced-unary object
			| "tag" %tag											# declaring tags

			| Object %propAccess %tag ":" Expression				# setting tags
			| Object "<:" Expression								# insertion

			| "if" Expression ":" BracedBlock ("else" BracedBlock):?	# conditionals
			| "for" VarList "in" Expression ":" BracedBlock			# for-loop (TODO: support destructuring)

			| "=>" Expression										# TODO: returns are not allowed to have commas beforehand,
																	#       so this may need to be moved to the "Block" rule

BracedBlock ->	"(" Block ")"             {% d => d[1] %}
			| "{" Block "}"               {% d => d[1] %}           # "{" and "}" are for indented blocks

SpacedItem	-> Ternary												# note that spaced list items cannot be SpacedUnary objects
			| %identifier %period									# true statements
			| %identifier "^^"										# shorthand property names
			| ("..."|"â€¦") Object										# spread operator

# note: using Javascript operator precedence:
#	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence

Expression	-> Ternary												# operator expression, starting from lowest precedence
			| SpacedUnary											# any expression can also be a single spaced-unary object

Ternary		-> Or "?" Ternary "else" Ternary						# right associative
			| Or

Or			-> Or "|" And | And
And			-> And "&" Eq | Eq

Eq			-> Eq ("=="|"="|"!=="|"!=") Compare | Compare
Compare		-> Compare ("<="|">="|"<"|">") Sum | Sum

Sum			-> Sum ("+"|"-") Product | Product
Product		-> Product ("*"|"/"|"%") Exp | Exp
Exp			-> Unary "**" Exp | Unary								# right associative

Unary		-> %unary_op Unary | Object

SpacedUnary	-> %unary_op:* %spaced_unary %unary_op:* Object         # at least one spaced_unary, and exactly one operand

Object 		-> "(" Block ")"										# creation
