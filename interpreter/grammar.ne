# Note that some things are either impossible to check in the grammar (due to modular parsing), or just more difficult.
# So we defer some of these checks to post-grammar parsing.

# Checks deferred to post-process:
#	parameters can be declared inside or outside the block, but not both
#	braced blocks and indented blocks have different rules for where the "template" keyword can go
#	nested blocks with special restrictions, eg:
#		in conditionals, the braced block actually has to be a one-item list
#		for bracket property access, the bracket block actually has to be a one-item list
#		for object destructuring, 
#	private identifiers can't be used in property access, eg `foo._bar`
