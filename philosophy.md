philosophy



timeless and unordered

time and order can be a property



feedback is unavoidable
if you have independent actors, how can you prevent feedback?



properties, not hierarchies

scope is an approximation
for example, file-system
imagine if you could only put each song into one playlist

but many languages do have a built-in hierarchal structure
type systems
this is why interfaces are often better than types
that is why axis doesn't have a type system
instead
type as a property
